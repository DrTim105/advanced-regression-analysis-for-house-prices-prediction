My solution for the Kaggle House Prices competition, implementing a comprehensive data science workflow with multiple regression techniques and Jupyter notebooks.
# Kaggle House Prices Competition Solution

This is a solution for the Kaggle House Prices competition. The goal of this competition is to predict the sale price of houses in Ames, Iowa based on various features like the size, number of rooms, location, etc. The evaluation metric for this competition is the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the actual sale price.

## Approach

The solution was developed using the following steps:

### Data Preprocessing

- Load the data from CSV files.
- Clean the data to fix any errors or inconsistencies.
- Encode the statistical data type (numeric, categorical).
- Impute any missing values.

### Establish Baseline

- Compute the cross-validated RMSLE score for a feature set using XGBoost. This is used to establish a baseline score to judge feature engineering techniques against.

### Feature Utility Scores

- Compute mutual information scores between each feature in the dataset X and the target variable y.
- Additionally, compute the pairwise correlation coefficients between features and drop those that have a correlation coefficient greater than the specified threshold.
- Finally, drop all uninformative features.

### Feature Engineering

- Create new features with Pandas.
- Apply k-Means clustering.
- Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Apply PCA to indicate outliers.

### Target Encoding

- Use target encoding to improve the accuracy of the model.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

- Tune the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model to improve its accuracy.

### Train Model and Create Submissions

- Use the trained model to make predictions from the test set.
- Train XGBoost on the training data.
- Create feature set from the original data.
- Save the predictions to a CSV file.

## Requirements

The following libraries were used to develop the solution:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- xgboost

## Conclusion

The solution achieved an RMSE score of 0.12 on the Kaggle leaderboard, which is in the top 15% of submissions. I'll also be continually updating the code on Kaggle to improve the model.
The solution uses a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to achieve high accuracy. The hyperparameters of the XGBoost model are tuned to improve its accuracy, and target encoding is used to improve the accuracy of the model. The techniques used in this solution can be applied to other machine learning problems as well.
